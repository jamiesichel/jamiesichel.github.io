description: <p>Critter Cards is an augmented reality (AR) virtual pets game that I am creating. The game's current iteration served as my thesis project for my MA. I plan to fully realize this game at a later date.</p><br /><p align="left">Critter Cards combines the portability of older virtual pet designs (such as Tamagotchi) with meaningful breeding and collecting mechanics. I wanted Critter Cards to embody all the positive traits of pet ownership and virtual pet video games, without the stressors associated. As part of my MA research, I isolated features that can cause stress and anxiety in users in order to either eliminate or lessen those mechanics. I also presented the "science of cute" and what objective design elements make a character cute, and therefore help increase our attachment to that character. I also researched the concepts of scarcity, ownership, and the pathos behind collecting. And finally, I came to the conclusion that by having a virtual pet exist in the physical play space through AR, players might feel an even deeper connection to their virtual pet.</p><p align="left">In Critter Cards you can design basic Critters (give it a try yourself by clicking the link at the end of this post!) and breed them to create a unique hybrid Critter that has the chance of inheriting rare attributes. In its current iteration, as seen in the video below, a child Critter has an equal chance to inherit any of its binary attributes, such as eyes, horns, and markings. A child's ear shape is a 50&#37; blend between each of its parents ears, and its colors are a random blend of its parents' colors. The virtual elements of the game are demonstrated in the following video.</p><p><video width="100%" controls><source src="img/portfolio/critterCards/critterCardsDemoLQ.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p><p align="left">To demonstrate what AR features the game would include, I allowed for the player to choose which of their Critters they wanted to play with in the physical play space by allowing them to assign their Critters to 3 different AR marker cards. Then, the player could sample two different mini-games. The first is a Simon Says style mini-game, where the player must remember the sequence of directions the Critter tells them and repeat it each turn. The second mini-game is a color matching game, where the Critter asks for a specific color and the player provides it with real-life object of that color in order to satisfy its needs.</p><p><video width="100%" controls><source src="img/portfolio/critterCards/critterCardsAR.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video></p><p align="left">I created every aspect of this game apart from the music, which was composed by the talented Jamie Day. This game was coded in C# and created in Unity using the Vuforia AR Engine. Its save system is currently a basic JSON system I designed, and all the assets were drawn on my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil.<br /><br />If you want to design your own Critter, be sure to click the itch.io link below! And, if you're feeling extra inspired, please send me a screenshot of your creation--I'd love to hear from you!</p><p><iframe frameborder="0" src="https://itch.io/embed/467648?border_width=5&amp;bg_color=ffffff&amp;fg_color=222222&amp;link_color=193d3f&amp;border_color=ffffff" width="216" height="175"></iframe></p>
