description: <p>I love drawing in any medium--here are some samples (descriptions below):</p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\stickermonster.png"><p align="left">Done digitally in Procrate on an iPad Pro with an Apple Pencil, this is my online persona, StickerMonster.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\dogfish.png"><p align="left">Created on my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil in Medibang Paint, this is the mascot I designed for Twitch streamer SleepingDogfish.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\dnd.png"><p align="left">Using my iPad Pro and Apple Pencil and Procrate, I made these character portraits for my current Dungeons and Dragons campaign that is streamed weekly on Twitch. Pictured are Sparky (me), a kobold tinkerer, and Nightshade, a ravenfolk fixer.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\gillyscene.png"><p align="left">Painted in fluid acrylic and watercolors, I created this scene with my character Gilly to be featured on a vertical banner for my old illustration business.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\process.png"><p align="left">A glimpse into my painting process, top left is a pencil sketch, top right is inking, bottom left has base shadows in fluid acrylics, and bottom right is after finishing it with watercolors.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\biggs.png"><p align="left">A character originally designed for my "I've Created a Monster" series, Biggs became a fan favorite, so I rendered him in different styles like this one--done in Medibang Paint on my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil. This design was later turned into a series of acrylic ornaments.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\paper.png"><p align="left">On the left is a shadowbox created from paper and painted in watercolor and fluid acrylic. On the right is a fake taxidermy head of Biggs (pictured above), made of paper with foam eyes and backplate.</p></p><p align="center"><img src="img\artandillustration\figuredrawings.png"><p align="left">Both drawn traditionally, the left is a charcoal and pastel rendering of a model from a figure drawing session.
