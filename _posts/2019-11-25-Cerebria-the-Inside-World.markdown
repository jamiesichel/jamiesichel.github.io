description: <p>I was contracted to design over 80 characters for Mindclash Game's Cerebria<span>&#58;</span> The Inside World. I rendered the illustrations in pencil, and they were finished in-house by the Mindclash team. Each character is meant to represent a different emotion and evolve into a stronger form of the emotion.</p><p><img src="img/cerebria/cerebria1.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"><p align="left">Pessimism and Narcissism</p></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/cerebria2.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"><p align="left">Affection and Adoration</p></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/cerebria3.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"><p align="left">Courage and Heroism</p></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/cerebria4.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"><p align="left">Confidence and Self Respect</p></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/cerebria5.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"><p align="left">Insecurity and Doubt</p></p><p><p align="left">The following images are from the <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218479/cerebria-inside-world" target="_blank">BoardGameGeek</a> page for Cerebria.</p><img src="img/cerebria/screenshot.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/screenshot1.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/screenshot2.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/screenshot3.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/screenshot4.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/cerebria/screenshot5.jpg" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p>
