description: <p>As an artist for <a href="http://bdcraft.net" target=_blank>BDcraft</a>, I spend a majority of my time creating assets for Minecraft resource packs. I designed and created almost all the items and many of the entities for GrungeBDcraft, as well as updates to our other packs, PureBDcraft and VanillaBDcraft.</p><p>I am also working on some other projects, doing concept art, texturing, and even a little bit of coding and UI (unfortunately I can't share images of those yet - sorry!).</p><p><img src="img/bdcraft/item_examples.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/bdcraft/entity_examples.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p><p><img src="img/bdcraft/other_examples.png" class="img-responsive img-centered"></p>
